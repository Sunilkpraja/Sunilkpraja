I have completed my graduation in B.E. Computer science and engineering in 2019. 

Experianced 3.5 years as a IT Professional , I am considering a career change to Power BI Developer. Having a keen interest in raw data, statistics, and communication, I can establish machine learning through the deployment of machine learning models, and construct dashboards that tell a story.
