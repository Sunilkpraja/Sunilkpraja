I am currently working as a Power BI Developer in circulants software since 2022. 

I have 3.4 years of experience as an IT professional, and I am considering a career change to Power BI Developer. Having a keen interest in raw data, statistics, and communication, I can establish machine learning by deploying machine learning models and constructing dashboards that tell a story.
